### 🚨Copy and run the below commands in Cloud Shell:

```
import vertexai
from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel

def text_embedding(prompt):
    vertexai.init(project="REPLACE_YOUR_PROJECT_ID", location="us-central1")
    model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("text-embedding-005")
    embeddings = model.get_embeddings([prompt])
    vector = embeddings[0].values
    print(f"Length of embedding vector: {len(vector)}")
    return vector

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sample_text = "Future Cloud Skill"
    print(f"Processing text: '{sample_text}'")
    text_embedding(sample_text)
